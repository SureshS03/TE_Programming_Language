# TE Programming Language

## What is TE?

Well ,**TE** is an exciting and evolving **Tamil** programming language, currently in its early stages of development. It’s designed to be simple yet powerful, offering a unique approach to coding in Tamil. As of now, TE supports two data types: `en` (integer) and `eluthu` (string) and basic `input` and `print` function. While these features are basic, they lay a strong foundation for what’s to come.

I just getting started! TE is a language with immense potential, and with every update, I adding more functionalities to make it even more robust and versatile. Next update will have **Control Statement**

## How TE work?

**TE is an interpreter language** that seamlessly converts its code into a source code that can be executed by Python, making it versatile and easy to use. TE has its own quirky way of getting things done — it reads the first word of each line and then springs into action based on that word. Because of this unique approach, I like to call it the "First Word Programming Language" — because, in TE, the first word truly has the last word!

This is how TE works, and it’s as simple as it is effective. While TE might seem basic now, it's only the beginning. We're building a language that's not just functional, but also fun to use and it's in ***Tamil***
